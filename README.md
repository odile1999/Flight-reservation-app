**Objectives:**
To develop a database application under concurrent access.
To interface with a relational database from a Java application via JDBC.

## Details
* Design a database of the customers and the flights they book
* Complete a working prototype of the flight booking application that connects to the database (in Azure) then allows customers to use a CLI to search, book, cancel, etc. flights
* Wrote test cases for multiple conditions

#### Data Model

This service follows a [client-server model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Client%E2%80%93server_model).
Users interact with your service by running client application.
Savvy, frequent-flyer users may run several instances of your client application at once!
The client application can either 

1. store information locally (just inside the client program) and transiently (not saved after the program closes), 
in which case this information does not need to be stored in a server database.
2. store information globally (accessible to all client programs) and persistently (saved after the program closes),
in which case this information needs to be stored in a server database.

- **Users**: A user has a username (`varchar`), password (`varbinary`), and balance (`int`) in their account.
  All usernames should be unique in the system. Each user can have any number of reservations.
  Usernames are case insensitive (this is the default for SQL Server).
  Since we are salting and hashing our passwords through the Java application, passwords are case sensitive.
  You can assume that all usernames and passwords have at most 20 characters.

- **Itineraries**: An itinerary is either a direct flight (consisting of one flight: origin --> destination) or
  a one-hop flight (consisting of two flights: origin --> stopover city, stopover city --> destination). Itineraries are returned by the search command.

- **Reservations**: A booking for an itinerary, which may consist of one (direct) or two (one-hop) flights.
  Each reservation can either be paid or unpaid, cancelled or not, and has a unique ID.

- **create** takes in a new username, password, and initial account balance as input. It creates a new user account with the initial balance.
  It should return an error if negative, or if the username already exists. Usernames and passwords are checked case-insensitively.
 
- **login** takes in a username and password, and checks that the user exists in the database and that the password matches. To compute the hash, adapt the above code.
  Within a single session (that is, a single instance of your program), only one user should be logged in. You can track this via a local variable in your program.
  If a second login attempt is made, please return "User already logged in".
  Across multiple sessions (that is, if you run your program multiple times), the same user is allowed to be logged in.
  This means that you do not need to track a user's login status inside the database.

- **search** takes as input an origin city (string), a destination city (string), a flag for only direct flights or not (0 or 1), the date (int), and the maximum number of itineraries to be returned (int).
  For the date, we only need the day of the month, since our dataset comes from July 2015. Return only flights that are not canceled, ignoring the capacity and number of seats available.
  If the user requests n itineraries to be returned, there are a number of possibilities:
    * direct=1: return up to n direct itineraries
    * direct=0: return up to n direct itineraries. If there are only k direct itineraries (where k < n), then return the k direct itineraries and up to (n-k) of the shortest indirect itineraries with the flight times. For one-hop flights, different carriers can be used for the flights. For the purpose of this assignment, an indirect itinerary means the first and second flight only must be on the same date (i.e., if flight 1 runs on the 3rd day of July, flight 2 runs on the 4th day of July, then you can't put these two flights in the same itinerary as they are not on the same day).


- **book** lets a user book an itinerary by providing the itinerary number as returned by a previous search.
  The user must be logged in to book an itinerary, and must enter a valid itinerary id that was returned in the last search that was performed *within the same login session*.
  Make sure you make the corresponding changes to the tables in case of a successful booking. Once the user logs out (by quitting the application),
  logs in (if they previously were not logged in), or performs another search within the same login session,
  then all previously returned itineraries are invalidated and cannot be booked.

  A user cannot book a flight if the flight's maximum capacity would be exceeded. Each flightâ€™s capacity is stored in the Flights table as in HW3, and you should have records as to how many seats remain on each flight based on the reservations.

  If booking is successful, then assign a new reservation ID to the booked itinerary.
  Note that 1) each reservation can contain up to 2 flights (in the case of indirect flights),
  and 2) each reservation should have a unique ID that incrementally increases by 1 for each successful booking.


- **pay** allows a user to pay for an existing unpaid reservation.
  It first checks whether the user has enough money to pay for all the flights in the given reservation. If successful, it updates the reservation to be paid.


- **reservations** lists all reservations for the currently logged-in user.
  Each reservation must have ***a unique identifier (which is different for each itinerary) in the entire system***, starting from 1 and increasing by 1 after each reservation is made.

  There are many ways to implement this. One possibility is to define a "ID" table that stores the next ID to use, and update it each time when a new reservation is made successfully.

  The user must be logged in to view reservations. The itineraries should be displayed using similar format as that used to display the search results, and they should be shown in increasing order of reservation ID under that username.
  Cancelled reservations should not be displayed.


- **cancel** lets a user to cancel an existing uncanceled reservation. The user must be logged in to cancel reservations and must provide a valid reservation ID.
  Make sure you make the corresponding changes to the tables in case of a successful cancellation (e.g., if a reservation is already paid, then the customer should be refunded).


- **quit** leaves the interactive system and logs out the current user (if logged in).
